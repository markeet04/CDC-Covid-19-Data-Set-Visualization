# CDC COVID-19 Data Set Visualization

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive visualization of COVID-19 data using various interactive and static visualizations. Leveraging advanced data processing techniques and visualization libraries, the project offers valuable insights into COVID-19 trends and patterns.

## Features
* **Bar Charts:** Visualize total deaths by state and age group using D3.js.
* **Pie Charts:** Provide comparative insights into COVID-19 data.
* **Leaflet Map:** Interactive map showing COVID-19 hotspots with Leaflet.js.
* **Data Processing:** Cleaned and organized data using Python and SQLite.
* **Additional Visualizations:** Enhanced with static charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Technologies Used
* **Python:** For data cleaning, organization, and querying.
* **SQLite:** Database management for storing and querying data.
* **D3.js:** For dynamic and interactive bar and pie charts.
* **Leaflet.js:** For interactive map visualization.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For static data visualizations.
* **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the web page.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is provided by the [CDC COVID-19 Data Set](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/data/index.html).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/markeet04/CDC-Covid-19-Data-Set-Visualization.git
    cd CDC-Covid-19-Data-Set-Visualization
    ```

2. Install Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Project
1. **Data Processing:**
   - Run the Python scripts to clean, organize, and query the data.

2. **Build and Deploy:**
   - For local development, open `index.html` in your browser.
   - For deployment, the project is hosted on GitHub Pages at [https://markeet04.github.io/CDC-Covid-19-Data-Set-Visualization/](https://markeet04.github.io/CDC-Covid-19-Data-Set-Visualization/).

## Usage
* Interact with the bar and pie charts to explore different aspects of COVID-19 data.
* Use the Leaflet map to view and analyze COVID-19 hotspots.
* Toggle between datasets to view varying insights.

## Further Enhancements
Here are some potential improvements for future development:
* **Additional Data Sources:** Integrate more datasets for a more comprehensive view, including real-time data updates.
* **Enhanced Interactivity:** Add advanced filtering options and user annotation features.
* **Improved Visualizations:** Develop heatmaps, time-series analysis, and other advanced visualizations.
* **Performance Optimization:** Optimize data loading and processing, and implement lazy loading techniques.
* **User Experience Enhancements:** Improve mobile responsiveness and add accessibility features.
* **Backend Integration:** Consider server-side processing and user account customization.
